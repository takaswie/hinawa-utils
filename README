## Introduction

This batch of Python 3 codes consists of modules and scripts to control
Audio and Music units on IEEE 1394 bus, with a help of PyGObject for
gobject-introspection to libhinawa APIs.

The modules include applications of below specifications:

 * IEEE 1212:2001 - IEEE Standard for a Control and Status Registers (CSR)
   Architecture for Microcomputer Buses
 * IEEE 1394:2008 - IEEE Standard for a High-Performance Serial Bus
 * AV/C Digital Interface Command Set General Specification Version 4.2
   (Sep. 2004, 1394 Trade Association)
 * AV/C Audio Subunit Specification 1.0 (Oct. 2000, 1394 Trade Association)
 * AV/C Connection and Compatibility Management Specification 1.1
   (Mar. 2003, 1394 Trade Association)
 * Configuration ROM for AV/C Devices 1.0 (Dec. 2000, 1394 Trade Association)
 * AV/C Stream Format Information Specification 1.1 - Working draft
   revision 0.5 (Apr. 2005, 1394 Trade Association)
 * Vendor specific protocols:
    * Some protocols for BridgeCo Enhanced Break Out Box (BeBoB) of
      BridgeCo AG.
    * General and extended protocol for Digital Interface Communication
      Engine (DICE) of TC Applied Technologies and ASICs of DiceII,
      TCD2210 (Dice Mini), TCD2220 (Dice Jr.).
    * Protocol for Fireworks board module of Echo Audio corporation.
    * Protocol for Digi 00x series of Digidesign.
    * Protocol for FireWire series of TEAC (TASCAM).
    * Common protocol for each generation of FireWire series of Mark of
      the Unicorn (MOTU).
    * Protofol for Fireface series of RME GmbH.
    * Some protocols specific to manufacturer.
